# siHealthPortal

siHealthPortal is an "Open Health" system which can integrate disparate data systems.
By making our healthcare solution "play nice" in the sandbox, we are allowing other systems to freely exchange data with us. The exchange of data allows researchers, 
clinicians, and care centres to provide a health care model which is beneficial to the patient and minimizes cost to the HCP.

Healthcare and the technological advancements should be available to all. Regardless of location, socio-economic status, or lack of government support.
By making the health care model "open", you can create a platform of solutions that are only limited by your imagination.\\


Please enjoy.
